# Intuition
This is a **Binary Search** base Algorithm.
# Approach

# Additional Information

# Complexity
*n : number of nodes*
- Time complexity: ***O(MLog(Mâˆ—N))***, because each node is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```cpp
/*
*   1. `exist` is used fot the number that dosen't in the multiplication matrix,
*       but match Kth smallest number exactly.
*   2. CountLEQ() for count the numbers that less than or equal to `val`.
*   3. findKthNumber() is a binary search base algorithm.
